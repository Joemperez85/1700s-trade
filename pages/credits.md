## Project Credits

* [Stephen Truman](mailto:s.tru989@gmail.com)
   * In this project, I worked on the introduction and data gathering. The introduction focus on explaining the projected course of scholarship and provided some background information related to piracy and slavery. To achieve this, I worked closely with my group members to ensure that the introduction conformed to the study and findings from the historiography and data results provide by my teammates. Furthermore, this introduction explained the digital tools used for this project, providing brief introductions into the utilization of the tools used. Secondly, I was responsible for gathering data to provide our visualization specialist. The data I gathered focus primarily on interaction of piracy on the slave trade from the 1700-1750s to answer a specific question about how piracy effected the economy surrounding the west indies.
