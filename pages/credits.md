   * Replace with your discription of role in the project

   *  For the group project my role is to extract the data that links trade plundering and piracy in the 1700’s scrapped by the project leader (Stephen) and compose the data in a legible cohesive form similar to a research paper. Arguing that piracy made a significant impact on the economics of the slave trade in the 1700’s. For this I will need to find trends throughout the data by using text analysis and Orange3. I will need to brush up on these topics as these are recently taught in class. Another one of my responsibilities is to compose the historiography surrounding the study of 1700’s piracy in the Caribbean. As a group it is our duty to understand what has already been written and how we as historians can add to the scholarship.  In finalization of the project, I will work with our data visualization expert (Joe) and link the written portion with the respected visualization
