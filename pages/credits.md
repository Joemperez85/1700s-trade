   * By gathering the data generated from the 8-10 sources, we will demonstrate fact-finding visualization comparing the relationship between pirating and slavery in the 1700â€™s West Indies. The economic relationship regarding the effects of these practices will be examined. There will be a written initial findings and problems encounters report along with diagrams generated using Tableau. Another program that will be used is Orange3 to show a precise relationship and some digital effects for the project. Once the data is scraped and forwarded to vitalization, the imagery is constructed and explained to the viewers. During the scraping and data generating process, the visual producer will review the previous class material along with tutorials to better understand how to input the visualization on Github in a manner that will make sense to the viewers.
